<p class="text">It was my first time traveling to New Delhi and I was eager to explore the place. After careful research, I decided to stay in a backpackers hostel - TripSolo. I was pleasantly surprised to find out how comfortable and convenient it was to stay in a backpackers hostel as compared to the traditional low-budget accommodation.</p>
<p class="text">As an international traveller, it was comforting to know that TripSolo hosted many other travellers like me. I felt a sense of camaraderie and community at the hostel. The backpackers hostel was a safe and comfortable place to stay. The hostel had a full-service restaurant, a bar, and a library, making it an ideal place to relax and unwind after a long day of sight-seeing. The dorms were spacious and clean, and each room had its own television, reading corner, and private bathroom. </p>
<p class="text">Another advantage of staying at TripSolo was the convenience of meeting other travellers. The hostel had a lounge where I could socialize with other guests from all over the world. As a first-time international tourist to New Delhi, this was a great way to learn about the culture and discover the best places to visit.</p>
<p class="text">In conclusion, my experience at TripSolo was more than I expected. It was an ideal place for international travellers looking to explore New Delhi in a safe and affordable way. Moreover, the cost-savings I got by staying in a hostel were absolutely tremendous! It was much more affordable than traditional low-budget accommodation options â€“ especially with the discounts and promotions that TripSolo offers. As a first-time traveller, I highly recommend Tripsolo to any international tourist visiting New Delhi.</p>
